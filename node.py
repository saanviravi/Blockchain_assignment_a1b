Network node that manages multiple blockchain forks.

=== NAKAMOTO CONSENSUS ===

This implementation follows Nakamoto Consensus, the breakthrough innovation
that allows a decentralized network to agree on a single transaction history
without a central authority.

Key principles:

1. LONGEST CHAIN RULE
   - Always consider the longest valid chain as the "true" chain
   - When you receive a new block, add it to whatever chain it extends
   - When building a new block, always build on the longest chain
   - This ensures all honest nodes eventually converge on the same chain

2. TIE-BREAKING
   - When two chains have equal length, stick with the one you saw first
   - Only switch to a different chain if it becomes longer
   - This prevents unnecessary chain reorganizations

3. PROOF OF WORK
   - Miners must find a nonce that makes the block hash below DIFFICULTY
   - This makes it computationally expensive to create blocks
   - An attacker would need >50% of network hashpower to rewrite history

4. BLOCK REWARDS (Coinbase)
   - Miners receive newly created coins for finding valid blocks
   - This incentivizes honest mining behavior
   - Coinbase transactions have no inputs - they create new money

5. FORK HANDLING
   - Temporary forks are normal when two miners find blocks simultaneously
   - The network naturally resolves forks as one chain becomes longer
   - Transactions in orphaned blocks return to the mempool

        The genesis block is special:
        - It's the first block in the chain (no previous block)
        - Its coinbase transaction creates the initial coins
        - All nodes must agree on the same genesis block

        You need to:
        1. Create UTXOs from all transactions in the genesis block
        2. Create a new Blockchain with the genesis block
        3. Add the blockchain to self.chains

        === NAKAMOTO CONSENSUS: FORK HANDLING ===

        When a new block arrives, we don't immediately know if it will be
        part of the longest chain. Two miners might find valid blocks at
        nearly the same time, creating a temporary fork.

        Our strategy:
        1. Accept ALL valid blocks that extend ANY known chain tip
        2. Each valid block creates a new "fork" in our view
        3. When building blocks, we always choose the longest fork
        4. Eventually, one fork will become longer and "win"

        You need to:
        1. Find a chain where the block's prev hash matches the last block
        2. Validate the block (PoW and all transactions)
        3. Create a new chain (fork) with the block appended
        4. Update UTXOs for all transactions in the block

        For convenience, also accepts a single Transaction (auto-wrapped in list).

        === NAKAMOTO CONSENSUS: LONGEST CHAIN RULE ===

        This method implements a core principle of Nakamoto Consensus:
        always build on the longest valid chain.

        Why? Because the longest chain represents the most cumulative
        proof-of-work, meaning the most computational effort was spent
        on it. An attacker trying to rewrite history would need to
        outpace the entire honest network.

        You need to:
        1. Find the longest chain (use max() with key=len)
        2. Validate all transactions against that chain's UTXOs
           - First transaction can be coinbase
           - Transactions can spend outputs from earlier txs in same block
        3. Create and mine a new block with Block(prev, txs, nonce)
